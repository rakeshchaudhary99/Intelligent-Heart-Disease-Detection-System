# Heart Diseases Dedicator

Machine learning  project in python

Heart disease detection using ML classifier KNN Algorithm 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# INTRODUCTION

Hospital with an  number of patients coming in reporting various cardiac symptoms.
A cardiologist measures vitals & hands you this data to perform Data Analysis and predict whether certain patients have Heart Disease. We would like to make a Machine Learning algorithm where we can train our AI to learn & improve from experience. Thus, we would want to classify patients as either positive or negative for Heart Disease.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Goal

We have a data which classified if patients have heart disease or not according to features in it.
We will try to use this data to create a model which tries predictif a patient has this disease or not.

1. Positive (+) = 1, patient diagnosed with Heart Disease

2. Negative (-) = 0, patient not diagnosed with Heart Disease
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Objective

To make a web application that will detect that whether a person has heart disease or not
